# JavaScript & OOPs

> ### Is JS have OOPs ?

Yes, JavaScript does have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015 specification (often referred to as ES6). However, it's important to note that JavaScript is primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words, it provides a more fami syntax for developers coming from class-based languages such as Java or C++, but under he it works somewhat differently.
